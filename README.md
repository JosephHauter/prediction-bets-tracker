# Plan and build framework
We need an edge and some research 
1. track whales with high profit win rate (avoid bots we cant analyze their strategy)
- track top wallet addresses
- replicate their trades automatically
- score wallets by performance
- alert when “smart” wallets enter a market
  
2. Arbitrage Bot
- research arbitrage formulas

3. AI / Probability-Driven Bots
- If the AI says something has a 60% chance but the market prices it at 45%, the bot can go long. But: These models are just probabilistic estimates — not oracle truth. They can be wrong.
- dependent on tracking news!?

4. Trend / Signal Bots
- order book trends
- volume spikes
- price momentum
- correlated markets
- 
Data(could have some limits):
- Polymarket api free
- kalshi api free
